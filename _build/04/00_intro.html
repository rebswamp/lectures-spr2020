<h1 id="Prediction-Models-and-Data-Analysis">Prediction Models and Data Analysis<a class="anchor-link" href="#Prediction-Models-and-Data-Analysis"> </a></h1><p>The syllabus says that the rest of the class is about</p>
<blockquote><p>understanding the how “data analysis/ML/«buzz word #51»” fit into the bigger picture of producing and using knowledge.* to quote Prof Gunther: data &lt; info &lt; knowledge &lt; wisdom</p>
<p>what we’re going to do with the data. executing and improving a model. applied econometrics (ie more conceptual than mathematical rigor) to understand and improve the output</p>
<p>learning from the model: what does the output of my analysis mean? (A and B are related, but WHY)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's what we're going to do. We have enough raw tools and you should have (nearly) completed your first farm-to-table analysis  (scrap, clean, and process the data) for Assignment 5.</p>
<p>Over the next month, we going to cover</p>
<ul>
<li>regression (how-to, why-to, and what it "means")</li>
<li>boosted regression trees</li>
<li>clustering algorithms</li>
<li>natural language processing</li>
<li>the whole time, we're going to stay focused on "WHY" we are doing what we are doing rather than just flying ahead blind</li>
</ul>
<p>This should be fun!</p>
