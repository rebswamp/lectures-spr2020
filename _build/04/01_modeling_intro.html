While the students are very bright, they spend WAY too much time using fancy statistical methods and not enough time framing the right questions and contextualizing their answers. If you want to be a good data scientist, you should spend ~49% of your time developing your statistical intuition (i.e. how to ask good questions of the data), and ~49% of your time on domain knowledge (improving overall understanding of your field). Only ~2% on methods per se. - Nate Silver</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Start-with-an-interesting-question-or-problem">Start with an interesting question or problem<a class="anchor-link" href="#Start-with-an-interesting-question-or-problem"> </a></h3><blockquote><p>Before you begin the analysis, know the questions you're trying to answer and what you're trying to accomplish - don't fall into an analytical rabbit hole. Additionally, you should know some basic things about your potential data - what data sources are available to answer the questions? How is that data structured? Is it in a database? CSVs? Third-party APIs? What tools will you be able to use for the analysis?</p>
<p><strong>Your approach will likely change throughout, but it's helpful to start with a plan and adjust.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two types of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relationships: Do airline closures affect how VCs monitor portfolio companies? <em>(Positively, negatively, or not? How much? Is the relationship because one causes the other, or something else?)</em></li>
<li>Predictions: Which loans will default? </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Pick-your-model(s)">Pick your model(s)<a class="anchor-link" href="#Pick-your-model(s)"> </a></h3><p><strong>A model is an idealized representation of a system</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"All models are wrong, but some are useful" - George Box<ul>
<li>Really! </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relationship model: When people have one ice cream cone, they are 2% more likely to drown<ul>
<li>Model should summarize the data</li>
<li>Simpler models are better because they are easier to interpret</li>
<li><strong>Example: Linear models (usually regression) are nice: $final grade = b + m * midterm grade$</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prediction model: Loan defaults over the next three months are 20% more likely for restaurant and service workers.<ul>
<li>More complex models are often favored</li>
<li>May not summarize the data, and often are impossible to interpret</li>
<li><strong>Example: Nearest neighbor model: $final grade = nearest neighbor(midterm grade)$</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To estimate any model</strong></p>
<p>We will talk in depth about a few models in class, but generally, these three steps always apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a model. (For example: find the "center" of a univariate distribution, regression, logistic)<ul>
<li>Use knowledge about the area to help pick </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select a loss function. (For example: Mean squared error, mean absolute deviation, R2)<ul>
<li>There are many loss functions!</li>
<li>The loss function choice affects the accuracy and speed of estimation</li>
<li>Choice depends on the estimation task</li>
<li>Qualitative or quantitative data?</li>
<li>Are all errors equal? (A false negative on a cancer test is much worse than a false positive!)</li>
<li>Do outliers matter more or less? </li>
<li>Some models often imply the loss function. For example, regression's loss function is almost always Mean Squared Error. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fit the model by minimizing the loss.</li>
