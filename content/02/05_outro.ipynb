    "\n",
    "You've already merged datasets. But so far, our examples have been \"well-behaved\" so it was easy to just proceed. But real world datasets are messy (bad variable names, poor documentation) and big, and so merging isn't always as easy as \"just do it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### A nice overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.07-merge-and-join.html) has a wonderful breakdown of the mechanics of merging. You should read it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important parameters of `pd.merge`\n",
    "\n",

    "**Key functions:**\n",
    "- `right`, `left` - your datasets\n",
    "- `on` - a single variable or a list of variables you're matching\n",
    "    - if the variable names aren't the same in the datasets (e.g. \"ID\" in one and \"identity\" in the other), use `left_on` and `right_on`\n",
    "- `how` =\n",
    "    - \"inner\" --> obs in both datasets \n",
    "    - \"left\" --> inner + all unmatched obs in left \n",
    "    - \"right\" (inner + all unmatched obs in right), right, outer\n",
    "    - \"left\" (inner + all unmatched obs in left), right, outer\n",
    "- `suffix` = when a variable is in both datasets, how should we name each. \n",
    "    - **It's a good idea to always use this option and specific the source, because the default option is uninformative! **\n",
    "- `indicator=True` will create a variable saying which dataset the variable came from\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many observations will my merge produce?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on `how` you merge the datasets. But also, any time you merge datasets, you should think about the variables you're merging `on` (the \"keys\") and ask:\n",
    "1. Is it 1 observation per key in one, both, or neither? \n",
    "2. Am I doing 1:1, 1:M, M:1, or M:M merge? The differences are huge!\n",
    "3. Related: What's the \"observation level\" before and after? Which variables will be at different levels?\n",
    "2. Is the key ever empty in either datasets? \n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the datasets below. Let's try merging different combinations and see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also see what happens when we repeat a merge or try to merge in a dataset with a variable of the same name."

    "### Good merging habits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Specify `how` and `suffix`. \n",
    "2. Before the merge think about (1) the observation levels in the left and right (2) `how` you're merging and (3) whether you think the merge is 1:1, 1:M, M:M, or M:1. Guess how many observations you'll have (more or less than left? more or less than right or left?) and then check afterwards. \n",
    "3. Look at the data! _(Example: In the golden rules lecture \"Good and Bad Data\" example, if we merged the firm-level data to the firm-year level data, check that \"GM\"'s first year is matched to all annual observations for GM.)_\n",
    "4. `describe()` the data and look at \"count\" for each variable (and also `isnull().sum()` to count missing observations). Does the count make sense?\n",
    "    - Repeat this for each section of the merged dataset (the observations from the left data, from the right data, and from both). For example,  `df.query('_merge != \"right_only\").describe()` will describe the merged dataset's observations from the left data. \n",
    "5. Going forward, remember the new observation level. I often actively name the dataframe to remind myself exactly that. For example, I know exactly how `state_industry_year_df` and `state_industry_df` should differ.      \n",

    "[These slides](https://github.com/matthewbrems/ODSC-missing-data-may-18/blob/master/Analysis%20with%20Missing%20Data.pdf) on missing data are quite good! [This article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/working-with-missing-data-in-pandas/) has examples too.\n",
